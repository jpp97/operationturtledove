          History of the org
        </h1>
        <p>
          While looking for resources to assist those who are dealing with domestic violence Operation Turtle Dove founders realized there were no resources specifically for students.
          Operation Turtle Dove was born with a focus on providing a wealth of resources to UAlbany students facing domestic violence, while also working to educate the student population
          about the realities of domestic violence on the student population. Operation Turtle Dove offers monthly seminars on different topics related to domestic violence, with different
          speakers from both within and outside of the UAlbany community. Operation Turtle Dove also has a volunteer staffed hotline that is open from 8am-8pm for students to use to find out
          about resources or use as a liaison with university police or CAPS. Operation Turtle Dove can help any UAlbany student facing domestic violence find affordable off-campus housing,
          connect them with counseling options outside of CAPS, and point them in the direction of partner organizations that would be able to assist with things like finding a job or getting
          food. Operation Turtle Dove strives for all students to be able to get the help and support they not only need but deserve.
